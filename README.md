# jarmonik.org
jarmonik's homepage went down due to his hosting provider no longer providing service. He in the past expressed the desire to have his own homepage. Since jarmonik is a legendary contributor to Orbiter, I took the liberty to put this homepage together for him. If someone could pass this message along to him on Orbiter-Forum that'd be appreciated  :beer:

jarmonik.org

To jarmonik:

The github repo for the site is here: https://github.com/computerex/jarmonik.org

I have added you as a collaborator. GitHub hooks have been setup to build jarmonik.org automatically when changes are pushed.

I hope this is useful to you. You only need to clone the repo, make changes in markdown and push. No need to run/build site on local, but you can by installing golang then running the makesite/serve scripts.

(all content is in simple markdown files. create new ones in the posts folder to make new posts, create new ones in the root folder to create new pages)
